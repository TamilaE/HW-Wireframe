                    </div>
                    <p>Dubai is a global city and business hub of the Middle East.[9] It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo.[10] Oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.[11] Dubai's economy now relies on revenues from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.</p>
                    <h2>Burj Al Arab</h2>
                    <p>The Burj Al Arab (Arabic: برج العرب, Tower of the Arabs), a luxury hotel, is frequently described as "the world's only 7-star", though its management has said it has never made that claim. A Jumeirah Group spokesperson is quoted as saying: "There's not a lot we can do to stop it. We're not encouraging the use of the term. We've never used it in our advertising. The hotel opened in December 1999.</p>
                    <h3>Burj Khalifa</h3>
                    <p>Burj Khalifa, known as the Burj Dubai before its inauguration, is a 828 metres (2,717 ft) high[168] skyscraper in Dubai, and the tallest building in the world. The tower was inspired by the structure of the desert flower Hymenocallis. It was constructed by more than 30 contracting companies around the world with workers of a hundred nationalities. It is an architectural icon. The building opened in 2010.</p>
                    <div id=paragraph>
                            <p>Tourism is an important part of the Dubai government's strategy to maintain the flow of foreign cash into the emirate. Dubai's lure for tourists is based mainly on shopping,[143][144] but also on its possession of other ancient and modern attractions. As of 2013, Dubai was the 7th most visited city of the world.</p>
